## Step 1: Set Up Your AWS Account
1. Go to the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/).
2. Sign in or create a new account if you don't have one.
3. Navigate to the **IAM** (Identity and Access Management) service to create a new user with programmatic access.
4. Assign the user appropriate permissions, such as `AdministratorAccess` or specific permissions for API Gateway and Lambda.   
5. Save the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key securely.

## Step 2: Create a Lambda Function
1. In the AWS Management Console, navigate to the **Lambda** service.
2. Click on **Create function**.
3. Choose **Author from scratch**.
4. Enter a function name, select a runtime (e.g., Python, Node.js), and set the execution role to the one you created in Step 1.
5. Click **Create function**.
6. In the function code editor, write your API logic. For example, a simple Python function might look like this:
   ```python
   def lambda_handler(event, context):
       return {
           'statusCode': 200,
           'body': 'Hello, World!'
       }
   ```
7. Click **Deploy** to save your changes.

## Step 3: Create an API Gateway
1. Navigate to the **API Gateway** service in the AWS Management Console.
2. Click on **Create API**.
3. Choose **HTTP API** for a simple setup or **REST API** for more features.
4. Click **Build**.
5. Enter a name for your API and configure any additional settings as needed.
6. Click **Next** to proceed to the integration step.
7. Select **Lambda** as the integration type and choose the Lambda function you created in Step 2.
8. Click **Next** and configure any routes you need (e.g., `/hello`).
9. Review your settings and click **Create** to finalize the API.

## Step 4: Deploy Your API
1. In the API Gateway console, select your API.
2. Click on **Deployments** in the left sidebar.
3. Click on **Create** to create a new deployment stage.
4. Enter a stage name (e.g., `dev`, `prod`) and click **Deploy**.
5. Note the Invoke URL provided; this is the endpoint for your API.

## Step 5: Test Your API
1. Open a web browser or use a tool like Postman or curl.
2. Enter the Invoke URL followed by the route you configured (e.g., `https://your-api-id.execute-api.region.amazonaws.com/dev/hello`).
3. You should see the response from your Lambda function, such as `Hello, World!`.

## Step 6: Monitor and Manage Your API
1. In the API Gateway console, you can monitor your API's performance and usage under the **Metrics** section.
2. Use **CloudWatch Logs** to view logs generated by your Lambda function.
3. You can also set up throttling, caching, and other features to optimize your API's performance.
4. If you need to update your API, you can modify the Lambda function code or API Gateway settings and redeploy as needed.

## Conclusion
Congratulations! You have successfully uploaded your first API on AWS using Lambda and API Gateway. You can now expand your API by adding more routes, integrating with other AWS services, or implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms. Explore the AWS documentation for more advanced features and best practices to enhance your API's functionality and security.
